    <h1>What To Get ???</h1>
    <h2>Yet what do we buy? I mean the school provides most of the stuff.Well in my experience the school had all the pens and rulers etc we needed but sometimes i couldn't find what i needed like a scissor or a pencil or a ruler but i had to wait till someone
        was done using there's so that is something i would probably bring some pencils a rubber and maybe a ruler so u have more time to work then wait. And then comes socks my first day was pretty hard causes i was wearing this pink socks with little
        poops on them and people looked at me and told me that i need to wear black , white or gray so the next day i wore some black socks but they were Under my ankle so i had to find a new pair so I recommend u get socks that ARE UP TO UR ANKLE that
        are also black gray or white.( not a big deal but for some reason was so embarrassed ðŸ˜†)
